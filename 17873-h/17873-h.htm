<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Michael Drayton was born in 1563, at Hartshill, near Atherstone, in
Warwickshire, where a cottage, said to have been his, is still shown. He
early became a page to Sir Henry Goodere, at Polesworth Hall: his own
words give the best picture of his early years here.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> His education
would seem to have been good, but ordinary; and it is very doubtful if
he ever went to a university.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Besides the authors mentioned in the
Epistle to Henry Reynolds, he was certainly familiar with Ovid and
Horace, and possibly with Catullus: while there seems no reason to doubt
that he read Greek, though it is quite true that his references to Greek
authors do not prove any first-hand acquaintance. He understood French,
and read Rabelais and the French sonneteers, and he seems to have been
acquainted with Italian.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> His knowledge of English literature was
wide, and his judgement good: but his chief bent lay towards the
history, legendary and otherwise, of his native country, and his vast
stores of learning on this subject bore fruit in the <i>Polyolbion</i>.</p>

<p>While still at Polesworth, Drayton fell in love with his patron's
younger daughter, Anne;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and, though she married, in 1596, Sir Henry
Rainsford of Clifford, Drayton continued his devotion to her for many
years, and also became an intimate friend of her husband's, writing a
sincere elegy on his death.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> About February,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> 1591, Drayton paid a
visit to London, and published his first work, the <i>Harmony of the
Church</i>, a series of paraphrases from the Old Testament, in
fourteen-syllabled verse of no particular vigour or grace. This book was
immediately suppressed by order of Archbishop Whitgift, possibly because
it was supposed to savour of Puritanism.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The author, however,
published another edition in 1610; indeed, he seems to have had a
fondness for this style of work; for in 1604 he published a dull poem,
<i>Moyses in a Map of his Miracles</i>, re-issued in 1630 as <i>Moses his Birth
and Miracles</i>. Accompanying this piece, in 1630, were two other 'Divine
poems': <i>Noah's Floud</i>, and <i>David and Goliath</i>. <i>Noah's Floud</i> is, in
part, one of Drayton's happiest attempts at the catalogue style of
bestiary; and Mr. Elton finds in it some foreshadowing of the manner of
<i>Paradise Lost</i>. But, as a whole, Drayton's attempts in this direction
deserve the oblivion into which they, in common with the similar
productions of other authors, have fallen. In the dedication and preface
to the <i>Harmony of the Church</i> are some of the few traces of Euphuism
shown in Drayton's work; passages in the <i>Heroical Epistles</i> also occur
to the mind.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> He was always averse to affectation, literary or
otherwise, and in Elegy viij deliberately condemns Lyly's fantastic
style.</p>

<p>Probably before Drayton went up to London, Sir Henry Goodere saw that he
would stand in need of a patron more powerful than the master of
Polesworth, and introduced him to the Earl and Countess of Bedford.
Those who believe<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Drayton to have been a Pope in petty spite,
identify the 'Idea' of his earlier poems with Lucy, Countess of Bedford;
though they are forced to acknowledge as self-evident that the 'Idea' of
his later work is Anne, Lady Rainsford. They then proceed to say that
Drayton, after consistently honouring the Countess in his verse for
twelve years, abruptly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> transferred his allegiance, not forgetting to
heap foul abuse on his former patroness, out of pique at some temporary
withdrawal of favour. Not only is this directly contrary to all we know
and can infer of Drayton's character, but Mr. Elton has decisively
disproved it by a summary of bibliographical and other evidence. Into
the question it is here unnecessary to enter, and it has been mentioned
only because it alone, of the many Drayton-controversies, has cast any
slur on the poet's reputation.</p>

<p>In 1593, Drayton published <i>Idea, the Shepherds Garland</i>, in nine
Eclogues; in 1606 he added a tenth, the best of all, to the new edition,
and rearranged the order, so that the new eclogue became the ninth. In
these Pastorals, while following the <i>Shepherds Calendar</i> in many ways,
he already displays something of the sturdy independence which
characterized him through life. He abandons Spenser's quasi-rustic
dialect, and, while keeping to most of the pastoral conventions, such as
the singing-match and threnody, he contrives to introduce something of a
more natural and homely strain. He keeps the political allusions,
notably in the Eclogue containing the song in praise of <i>Beta</i>, who is,
of course, Queen Elizabeth. But an over-bold remark in the last line of
that song was struck out in 1606; and the new eclogue has no political
reference. He is not ashamed to allude directly to Spenser; and indeed
his direct debts are limited to a few scattered phrases, as in the
<i>Ballad</i> of <i>Dowsabel</i>. Almost to the end of his literary career,
Drayton mentions Spenser with reverence and praise.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>It is in the songs interspersed in the Eclogues that Drayton's best work
at this time is to be found: already his metrical versatility is
discernible; for though he doubtless remembered the many varieties of
metre employed by Spenser in the <i>Calendar</i>, his verses already bear a
stamp of their own. The long but impetuous lines, such as 'Trim up her
golden tresses with Apollo's sacred tree', afford a striking contrast to
the archaic romance-metre, derived from <i>Sir Thopas</i> and its fellows,
which appears in <i>Dowsabel</i>, and it again to the melancholy, murmuring
cadences of the lament for Elphin. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> must, however, be confessed that
certain of the songs in the 1593 edition were full of recondite conceits
and laboured antitheses, and were rightly struck out, to be replaced by
lovelier poems, in the edition of 1606. The song to Beta was printed in
<i>Englands Helicon</i>, 1600; here, for the first time, appeared the song of
<i>Dead Love</i>, and for the only time, <i>Rowlands Madrigal</i>. In these songs,
Drayton offends least in grammar, always a weak point with him; in the
body of the Eclogues, in the earlier Sonnets, in the Odes, occur the
most extraordinary and perplexing inversions. Quite the most striking
feature of the Eclogues, especially in their later form, is their bold
attempt at greater realism, at a breaking-away from the conventional
images and scenery.</p>

<p>Having paid his tribute to one poetic fashion, Drayton in 1594 fell in
with the prevailing craze for sonneteering, and published <i>Ideas
Mirrour</i>, a series of fifty-one 'amours' or sonnets, with two prefatory
poems, one by Drayton and one by an unknown, signing himself <i>Gorbo il
fidele</i>. The title of these poems Drayton possibly borrowed from the
French sonneteer, de Pontoux: in their style much recollection of
Sidney, Constable, and Daniel is traceable. They are ostensibly
addressed to his mistress, and some of them are genuine in feeling; but
many are merely imitative exercises in conceit; some, apparently, trials
in metre. These amours were again printed, with the title of 'sonnets',
in <i>1599</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, 1600, <i>1602</i>, 1603, <i>1605</i>, 1608, 1610, 1613, <i>1619</i>, and
1631, during the poet's lifetime. It is needless here to discuss whether
Drayton were the 'rival poet' to Shakespeare, whether these sonnets were
really addressed to a man, or merely to the ideal Platonic beauty; for
those who are interested in these points, I subjoin references to the
sonnets which touch upon them.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> From the prentice-work evident in
many of the <i>Amours</i>, it would seem that certain of them are among
Drayton's earliest poems; but others show a craftsman not meanly
advanced in his art. Nevertheless, with few exceptions, this first
'bundle of sonnets' consists rather of trials of skill, bubbles of the
mind; most of his sonnets which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> strike the reader as touched or
penetrated with genuine passion belong to the editions from 1599
onwards; implying that his love for Anne Goodere, if at all represented
in these poems, grew with his years, for the 'love-parting' is first
found in the edition of 1619. But for us the question should not be, are
these sonnets genuine representations of the personal feeling of the
poet? but rather, how far do they arouse or echo in us as individuals
the universal passion? There are at least some of Drayton's sonnets
which possess a direct, instant, and universal appeal, by reason of
their simple force and straightforward ring; and not in virtue of any
subtle charm of sound and rhythm, or overmastering splendour of diction
or thought. Ornament vanishes, and soberness and simplicity increase, as
we proceed in the editions of the sonnets. Drayton's chief attempt in
the jewelled or ornamental style appeared in 1595, with the title of
<i>Endimion and Phoebe</i>, and was, in a sense, an imitation of Marlowe's
<i>Hero and Leander</i>. <i>Hero and Leander</i> is, as Swinburne says, a shrine
of Parian marble, illumined from within by a clear flame of passion;
while <i>Endimion and Phoebe</i> is rather a curiously wrought tapestry, such
as that in Mortimer's Tower, woven in splendid and harmonious colours,
wherein, however, the figures attain no clearness or subtlety of
outline, and move in semi-conventional scenery. It is, none the less,
graceful and impressive, and of a like musical fluency with other poems
of its class, such as <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, or <i>Salmacis and
Hermaphrodius</i>. Parts of it were re-set and spoilt in a 1606 publication
of Drayton's, called <i>The Man in the Moone</i>.</p>

<p>In 1593 and 1594 Drayton also published his earliest pieces on the
mediaeval theme of the 'Falls of the Illustrious'; they were <i>Peirs
Gavesson</i> and <i>Matilda the faire and chaste daughter of the Lord Robert
Fitzwater</i>. Here Drayton followed in the track of Boccaccio, Lydgate,
and the <i>Mirrour for Magistrates</i>, walking in the way which Chaucer had
derided in his <i>Monkes Tale</i>: and with only too great fidelity does
Drayton adapt himself to the dullnesses of his model: fine rhetoric is
not altogether wanting, and there is, of course, the consciousness that
these subjects deal with the history of his beloved country, but neither
these, nor <i>Robert, Duke of Normandy</i> (1596), nor <i>Great Cromwell, Earl
of Essex</i> (1607 and 1609), nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> the <i>Miseries of Margaret</i> (1627) can
escape the charge of tediousness.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> <i>England's Heroical Epistles</i> were
first published in 1597, and other editions, of 1598, 1599, and 1602,
contain new epistles. These are Drayton's first attempt to strike out a
new and original vein of English poetry: they are a series of letters,
modelled on Ovid's <i>Heroides</i>,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> addressed by various pairs of lovers,
famous in English history, to each other, and arranged in chronological
order, from Henry II and Rosamond to Lady Jane Grey and Lord Guilford
Dudley. They are, in a sense, the most important of Drayton's writings,
and they have certainly been the most popular, up to the early
nineteenth century. In these poems Drayton foreshadowed, and probably
inspired, the smooth style of Fairfax, Waller, and Dryden. The metre,
the grammar, and the thought, are all perfectly easy to follow, even
though he employs many of the Ovidian 'turns' and 'clenches'. A certain
attempt at realization of the different characters is observable, but
the poems are fine rhetorical exercises rather than realizations of the
dramatic and passionate possibilities of their themes. In 1596, Drayton,
as we have seen, published the <i>Mortimeriados</i>, a kind of epic, with
Mortimer as its hero, of the wars between King Edward II and the
Barons.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It was written in the seven-line stanza of Chaucer's
<i>Troilus and Cressida</i> and Spenser's <i>Hymns</i>. On its republication in
1603, with the title of the <i>Barons' Wars</i>, the metre was changed to
<i>ottava rima</i>, and Drayton showed, in an excellent preface, that he
fully appreciated the principles and the subtleties of the metrical art.
While possessing many fine passages, the <i>Barons'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> Wars</i> is somewhat
dull, lacking much of the poetry of the older version; and does not
escape from Drayton's own criticism of Daniel's Chronicle Poems: 'too
much historian in verse, ... His rhymes were smooth, his metres well did
close, But yet his manner better fitted prose'.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The description of
Mortimer's Tower in the sixth book recalls the ornate style of <i>Endimion
and Phoebe</i>, while the fifth book, describing the miseries of King
Edward, is the most moving and dramatic. But there is a general
lifelessness and lack of movement for which these purple passages barely
atone. The cause of the production of so many chronicle poems about this
time has been supposed<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> to be the desire of showing the horrors of
civil war, at a time when the queen was growing old, and no successor
had, as it seemed, been accepted. Also they were a kind of parallel to
the Chronicle Play; and Drayton, in any case even if we grant him to
have been influenced by the example of Daniel, never needed much
incentive to treat a national theme.</p>

<p>About this time, we find Drayton writing for the stage. It seems
unnecessary here to discuss whether the writing of plays is evidence of
Drayton's poverty, or his versatility;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> but the fact remains that he
had a hand in the production of about twenty. Of these, the only one
which certainly survives is <i>The first part of the true and honorable
historie, of the life of Sir John Oldcastle, the good Lord Cobham,</i> &amp;c.
It is practically impossible to distinguish Drayton's share in this
curious play, and it does not, therefore, materially assist the
elucidation of the question whether he had any dramatic feeling or
skill. It can be safely affirmed that the dramatic instinct was nor
uppermost in his mind; he was a Seneca rather than a Euripides: but to
deny him all dramatic idea, as does Dr. Whitaker, is too severe. There
is decided, if slender, dramatic skill and feeling in certain of the
<i>Nymphals</i>. Drayton's persons are usually, it must be said, rather
figures in a tableau, or series of tableaux; but in the second and
seventh <i>Nymphals</i>, and occasionally in the tenth, there is real<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
dramatic movement. Closely connected with this question is the
consideration of humour, which is wrongly denied to Drayton. Humour is
observable first, perhaps, in the <i>Owle</i> (1604); then in the <i>Ode to his
Rival</i> (1619); and later in the <i>Nymphidia</i>, <i>Shepheards Sirena</i>, and
<i>Muses Elyzium</i>. The second <i>Nymphal</i> shows us the quiet laughter, the
humorous twinkle, with which Drayton writes at times. The subject is an
[Greek: ag&ocirc;n] or contest between two shepherds for the affections of a
nymph called Lirope: Lalus is a vale-bred swain, of refined and elegant
manners, skilled, nevertheless, in all manly sports and exercises;
Cleon, no less a master in physical prowess, was nurtured by a hind in
the mountains; the contrast between their manners is admirably
sustained: Cleon is rough, inclined to be rude and scoffing, totally
without tact, even where his mistress is concerned. Lalus remembers her
upbringing and her tastes; he makes no unnecessary or ostentatious
display of wealth; his gifts are simple and charming, while Cleon's are
so grotesquely unsuited to a swain, that it is tempting to suppose that
Drayton was quietly satirizing Marlowe's <i>Passionate Shepherd</i>. Lirope
listens gravely to the swains in turn, and makes demure but provoking
answers, raising each to the height of hope, and then casting them both
down into the depths of despair; finally she refuses both, yet without
altogether killing hope. Her first answer is a good specimen of her
banter and of Drayton's humour.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>On the accession of James I, Drayton hastened to greet the King with a
somewhat laboured song <i>To the Maiestie of King James</i>; but this poem
was apparently considered to be premature: he cried <i>Vivat Rex</i>, without
having said, <i>Mortua est eheu Regina</i>, and accordingly he suffered the
penalty of his 'forward pen',<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and was severely neglected by King and
Court. Throughout James's reign a darker and more satirical mood
possesses Drayton, intruding at times even into his strenuous
recreation-ground, the <i>Polyolbion</i>, and manifesting itself more
directly in his satires, the <i>Owle</i> (1604), the <i>Moon-Calfe</i> (1627), the
<i>Man in the Moone</i> (1606), and his verse-letters and elegies; while his
disappointment with the times, the country, and the King,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> flashes out
occasionally even in the Odes, and is heard in his last publication, the
<i>Muses Elizium</i> (1630). To counterbalance the disappointment in his
hopes from the King, Drayton found a new and life-long friend in Walter
Aston, of Tixall, in Staffordshire; this gentleman was created Knight of
the Bath by James, and made Drayton one of his esquires. By Aston's
'continual bounty' the poet was able to devote himself almost entirely
to more congenial literary work; for, while Meres speaks of the
<i>Polyolbion</i> in 1598,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and we may easily see that Drayton had the
idea of that work at least as early as 1594,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> yet he cannot have been
able to give much time to it till now. Nevertheless, the 'declining and
corrupt times' worked on Drayton's mind and grieved and darkened his
soul, for we must remember that he was perfectly prosperous then and was
not therefore incited to satire by bodily want or distress.</p>

<p>In 1604 he published the <i>Owle</i>, a mild satire, under the form of a
moral fable of government, reminding the reader a little of the
<i>Parlement of Foules</i>. <i>The Man in the Moone</i> (1606) is partly a
recension of <i>Endimion and Phoebe</i>, but is a heterogeneous mass of
weakly satire, of no particular merit. The <i>Moon-Calfe</i> (1627) is
Drayton's most savage and misanthropic excursion into the region of
Satire; in which, though occasionally nobly ironic, he is more usually
coarse and blustering, in the style of Marston.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> In 1605 Drayton
brought out his first 'collected poems', from which the <i>Eclogues</i> and
the <i>Owle</i> are omitted; and in 1606 he published his <i>Poemes Lyrick and
Pastorall</i>, <i>Odes</i>, <i>Eglogs</i>, <i>The Man in the Moone</i>. Of these the
<i>Eglogs</i> are a recension of the <i>Shepherd's Garland</i> of 1593: we have
already spoken of <i>The Man in the Moone</i>. The <i>Odes</i> are by far the most
important and striking feature of the book. In the preface, Drayton
professes to be following Pindar, Anacreon, and Horace, though, as he
modestly implies, at a great distance. Under the title of <i>Odes</i> he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
includes a variety of subjects, and a variety of metres; ranging from an
<i>Ode to his Harp</i> or <i>to his Criticks</i>, to a <i>Ballad of Agincourt</i>, or a
poem on the Rose compared with his Mistress. In the edition of 1619
appeared several more Odes, including some of the best; while many of
the others underwent careful revision, notably the <i>Ballad</i>. 'Sing wee
the Rose,' perhaps because of its unintelligibility, and the Ode to his
friend John Savage, perhaps because too closely imitated from Horace,
were omitted. Drayton was not the first to use the term <i>Ode</i> for a
lyrical poem, in English: Soothern in 1584, and Daniel in 1592 had
preceded him; but he was the first to give the name popularity in
England, and to lift the kind as Ronsard had lifted it in France; and
till the time of Cowper no other English poet showed mastery of the
short, staccato measure of the Anacreontic as distinct from the Pindaric
Ode. In the <i>Odes</i> Drayton shows to the fullest extent his metrical
versatility: he touches the Skeltonic metre, the long ten-syllabled line
of the <i>Sacrifice to Apollo</i>; and ascends from the smooth and melodious
rhythms of the <i>New Year</i> through the inspiring harp-tones of the
<i>Virginian Voyage</i> to the clangour and swing of the <i>Ballad of
Agincourt</i>. His grammar is possibly more distorted here than anywhere,
but, as Mr. Elton says, 'these are the obstacles of any poet who uses
measures of four or six syllables.' His tone throughout is rather that
of the harp, as played, perhaps, in Polesworth Hall, than that of any
other instrument; but in 1619 Drayton has taken to him the lute of Carew
and his compeers. In 1619 the style is lighter, the fancy gayer, more
exquisite, more recondite. Most of his few metaphysical conceits are to
be found in these later Odes, as in the <i>Heart</i>, the <i>Valentine</i>, and
the <i>Crier</i>. In the comparison of the two editions the nobler, if more
strained, tone of the earlier is obvious; it is still Elizabethan, in
its nobility of ideal and purpose, in its enthusiasm, in its belief and
confidence in England and her men; and this even though we catch a
glimpse of the Jacobean woe in the <i>Ode to John Savage</i>: the 1619 Odes
are of a different world; their spirit is lighter, more insouciant in
appearance, though perhaps studiedly so; the rhythms are more fantastic,
with less of strength and firmness, though with more of grace and
superficial beauty; even the very textual alterations, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> usually
increasing the grace and the music of the lines, remind the reader that
something of the old spontaneity and freshness is gone.</p>

<p>In 1607 and 1609, Drayton published two editions of the last and weakest
of his mediaeval poems&mdash;the <i>Legend of Great Cromwell</i>; and for the next
few years he produced nothing new, only attending to the publication of
certain reprints and new editions. During this time, however, he was
working steadily at the <i>Polyolbion</i>, helped by the patronage of Aston
and of Prince Henry. In 1612-13, Drayton burst upon an indifferent world
with the first part of the great poem, containing eighteen songs; the
title-page will give the best idea of the contents and plan of the book:
'Poly-Olbion or a Chorographicall Description of the Tracts, Riuers,
Mountaines, Forests, and other Parts of this renowned Isle of Great
Britaine, With intermixture of the most Remarquable Stories,
Antiquities, Wonders, Rarityes, Pleasures, and Commodities of the same:
Digested in a Poem by Michael Drayton, Esq. With a Table added, for
direction to those occurrences of Story and Antiquities, whereunto the
Course of the Volume easily leades not.' &amp;c. On this work Drayton had
been engaged for nearly the whole of his poetical career. The learning
and research displayed in the poem are extraordinary, almost equalling
the erudition of Selden in his Annotations to each Song. The first part
was, for various reasons, a drug in the market, and Drayton found great
difficulty in securing a publisher for the second part. But during the
years from 1613 to 1622, he became acquainted with Drummond of
Hawthornden through a common friend, Sir William Alexander of Menstry,
afterwards Earl of Stirling. In 1618, Drayton starts a correspondence;
and towards the end of the year mentions that he is corresponding also
with Andro Hart, bookseller, of Edinburgh. The subject of his letter was
probably the publication of the Second Part; which Drayton alludes to in
a letter of 1619 thus: 'I have done twelve books more, that is from the
eighteenth book, which was Kent, if you note it; all the East part and
North to the river Tweed; but it lies by me; for the booksellers and I
are in terms; they are a company of base knaves, whom I both scorn and
kick at.' Finally, in 1622, Drayton got Marriott, Grismand, and Dewe, of
London, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span> take the work, and it was published with a dedication to
Prince Charles, who, after his brother's death, had given Drayton
patronage. Drayton's preface to the Second Part is well worth quoting:</p>

<p>'<i>To any that will read it.</i> When I first undertook this Poem, or, as
some very skilful in this kind have pleased to term it, this Herculean
labour, I was by some virtuous friends persuaded, that I should receive
much comfort and encouragement therein; and for these reasons; First,
that it was a new, clear, way, never before gone by any; then, that it
contained all the Delicacies, Delights, and Rarities of this renowned
Isle, interwoven with the Histories of the Britons, Saxons, Normans, and
the later English: And further that there is scarcely any of the
Nobility or Gentry of this land, but that he is in some way or other by
his Blood interested therein. But it hath fallen out otherwise; for
instead of that comfort, which my noble friends (from the freedom of
their spirits) proposed as my due, I have met with barbarous ignorance,
and base detraction; such a cloud hath the Devil drawn over the world's
judgment, whose opinion is in few years fallen so far below all
ballatry, that the lethargy is incurable: nay, some of the Stationers,
that had the selling of the First Part of this Poem, because it went not
so fast away in the sale, as some of their beastly and abominable trash,
(a shame both to our language and nation) have either despitefully left
out, or at least carelessly neglected the Epistles to the Readers, and
so have cozened the buyers with unperfected books; which these that have
undertaken the Second Part, have been forced to amend in the First, for
the small number that are yet remaining in their hands. And some of our
outlandish, unnatural, English, (I know not how otherwise to express
them) stick not to say that there is nothing in this Island worth
studying for, and take a great pride to be ignorant in any thing
thereof; for these, since they delight in their folly, I wish it may be
hereditary from them to their posterity, that their children may be
begg'd for fools to the fifth generation, until it may be beyond the
memory of man to know that there was ever other of their families:
neither can this deter me from going on with Scotland, if means and time
do not hinder me, to perform as much as I have promised in my First
Song:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Till through the sleepy main, to <i>Thuly</i> I have gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seen the Frozen Isles, the cold <i>Deucalidon</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amongst whose iron Rocks, grim <i>Saturn</i> yet remains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound in those gloomy caves with adamantine chains.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And as for those cattle whereof I spake before, <i>Odi profanum vulgus, et
arceo</i>, of which I account them, be they never so great, and so I leave
them. To my friends, and the lovers of my labours, I wish all happiness.
<i>Michael Drayton.</i>'</p>

<p>The <i>Polyolbion</i> as a whole is easy and pleasant to read; and though in
some parts it savours too much of a mere catalogue, yet it has many
things truly poetical. The best books are perhaps the xiij, xiv, and xv,
where he is on his own ground, and therefore naturally at his best. It
is interesting to notice how much attention and space he devotes to
Wales. He describes not only the 'wonders' but also the fauna and flora
of each district; and of the two it would seem that the flowers
interested him more. Though he was a keen observer of country sights and
sounds (a fact sufficiently attested by the <i>Nymphidia</i> and the
<i>Nymphals</i>), it is evident that his interest in most things except
flowers was rather momentary or conventional than continuous and
heart-felt; but of the flowers he loves to talk, whether he weaves us a
garland for the Thame's wedding, or gives us the contents of a maund of
simples; and his love, if somewhat homely and unimaginative, is apparent
enough. But the main inspiration, as it is the main theme, of the
<i>Polyolbion</i> is the glory and might and wealth, past, present, and
future, of England, her possessions and her folk. Through all this
glory, however, we catch the tone of Elizabethan sorrow over the 'Ruines
of Time'; grief that all these mighty men and their works will perish
and be forgotten, unless the poet makes them live for ever on the lips
of men. Drayton's own voluminousness has defeated his purpose, and sunk
his poem by its own bulk. Though it is difficult to go so far as Mr.
Bullen, and say that the only thing better than a stroll in the
<i>Polyolbion</i> is one in a Sussex lane, it is still harder to agree with
Canon Beeching, that 'there are few beauties on the road', the beauties
are many, though of a quietly rural type, and the road, if long and
winding, is of good surface, while its cranks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span> constitute much of its
charm. It is doubtless, from the outside, an appalling poem in these
days of epitomes and monographs, but it certainly deserves to be rescued
from oblivion and read.</p>

<p>In 1618 Drayton contributed two <i>Elegies</i> to Henry FitzGeoffrey's
<i>Satyrs and Epigrames</i>. These were on the Lady Penelope Clifton, and on
'the death of the three sonnes of the Lord Sheffield, drowned neere
where Trent falleth into Humber'. Neither is remarkable save for
far-fetched conceits; they were reprinted in 1610, and again, with many
others, in the volume of 1627. In 1619 Drayton issued a folio collected
edition of his works, and reprinted it in 1620. In 1627 followed a folio
of wholly fresh matter, including the <i>Battaile of Agincourt</i>; <i>the
Miseries of Queene Margarite</i>, <i>Nimphidia</i>, <i>Quest of Cinthia</i>,
<i>Shepheards Sirena</i>, <i>Moone-Calfe</i>, and <i>Elegies upon sundry occasions</i>.
The <i>Battaile of Agincourt</i> is a somewhat otiose expansion, with purple
patches, of the <i>Ballad</i>; it is, nevertheless, Drayton's best lengthy
piece on a historical theme. Of the <i>Miseries of Queene Margarite</i> and
of the <i>Moone-Calfe</i> we have already spoken. The most notable piece in
the book is the <i>Nimphidia</i>. This poem of the Court of Fairy has
'invention, grace, and humour', as Canon Beeching has said. It would be
interesting to know exactly when it was composed and committed to paper,
for it is thought that the three fairy poems in Herrick's <i>Hesperides</i>
were written about 1626. In any case, Drayton's poem touches very
little, and chiefly in the beginning, on the subject of any one of
Herrick's three pieces. The style, execution, and impression left on the
reader are quite different; even as they are totally unlike those of the
<i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>. Herrick's pieces are extraordinary
combinations of the idea of 'King of Shadows', with a reality
fantastically sober: the poems are steeped in moonlight. In Drayton all
is clear day, or the most unromantic of nights; though everything is
charming, there is no attempt at idealization, little of the higher
faculty of imagination; but great realism, and much play of fancy.
Herrick's verses were written by Cobweb and Moth together, Drayton's by
Puck. Granting, however, the initial deficiency in subtlety of charm,
the whole poem is inimitably graceful and piquant. The gay humour, the
demure horror of the witchcraft, the terrible seriousness of the battle,
wonderfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span> realize the mock-heroic gigantesque; and while there is not
the minute accuracy of Gulliver in Lilliput, Drayton did not write for a
sceptical or too-prying audience; quite half his readers believed more
or less in fairies. In the metre of the poem Drayton again echoes that
of the older romances, as he did in <i>Dowsabel</i>. In the <i>Quest of
Cinthia</i>, while ostensibly we come to the real world of mortals, we are
really in a non-existent land of pastoral convention, in the most
pseudo-Arcadian atmosphere in which Drayton ever worked. The metre and
the language are, however, charmingly managed. <i>The Shepheards Sirena</i>
is a poem, apparently, 'where more is meant than meets the ear,' as so
often in pastoral poetry<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>; it is difficult to see exactly what is
meant; but the Jacobean strain of doubt and fear is there, and the poem
would seem to have been written some time earlier than 1627. The
<i>Elegies</i> comprise a great variety of styles and themes; some are really
threnodies, some verse-letters, some laments over the evil times, and
one a summary of Drayton's literary opinions. He employs the couplet in
his <i>Elegies</i> with a masterly hand, often with a deliberately rugged
effect, as in his broader Marstonic satire addressed to William Browne;
while the line of greater smoothness but equal strength is to be seen in
the letters to Sandys and Jeffreys. He is fantastic and conceited in
most of the threnodies; but, as is natural, that on his old friend, Sir
Henry Rainsford, is least artificial and fullest of true feeling. The
epistle to <i>Henery Reynolds. Of Poets and Poesie</i> shows Drayton as a
sane and sagacious critic, ready to see the good, but keen to discern
the weakness also; perhaps the clearest evidence of his critical skill
is the way in which nearly all of his judgements on his contemporaries
coincide with the received modern opinions.</p>

<p>In his later years Drayton enjoyed the patronage of the third Earl and
Countess of Dorset; and in <i>1630</i> he published his last volume, the
<i>Muses Elizium</i>, of which he dedicated the pastoral part to the Earl,
and the three divine poems at the end to the Countess. The <i>Muses
Elizium</i> proper consists of Ten Pastorals or Nymphals, prefaced by a
<i>Description of Elizium</i>. The three divine poems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span> have been mentioned
before, and were <i>Noah's Floud</i>, <i>Moses his Birth and Miracles</i>, and
<i>David and Goliah</i>. The <i>Nymphals</i> are the crown and summary of much of
the best in Drayton's work. Here he departed from the conventional type
of pastoral, even more than in the <i>Shepherd's Garland</i>; but to say that
he sang of English rustic life would hardly be true: the sixth
<i>Nymphal</i>, allowing for a few pardonable exaggerations by the
competitors, is almost all English, if we except the names; so is the
tenth with the same exception; the first and fourth might take place
anywhere, but are not likely in any country; the second is more
conventional; the fifth is almost, but not quite, English; the third,
seventh, and ninth are avowedly classical in theme; while the eighth is
a more delicate and subtle fairy poem than the <i>Nymphidia</i>. The fourth
and tenth <i>Nymphals</i> are also touched with the sadder, almost satiric
vein; the former inveighing against the English imitation of foreigners
and love of extravagance in dress; while the tenth complains of the
improvident and wasteful felling of trees in the English forests. This
last <i>Nymphal</i>, though designedly an epilogue, is probably rather a
warning than a despairing lament, even though we conceive the old satyr
to be Drayton himself. As a whole the <i>Nymphals</i> show Drayton at his
happiest and lightest in style and metre; at his moments of greatest
serenity and even gaiety; an atmosphere of sunshine seems to envelope
them all, though the sun sink behind a cloud in the last. His music now
is that of a rippling stream, whereas in his earlier days he spoke

<p>To estimate the poetical faculty of Drayton is a somewhat perplexing
task; for, while rarely subtle, or rising to empyrean heights, he wrote
in such varied styles, on such various themes, that the task, at first,
seems that of criticizing many poets, not one. But through all his work
runs the same eminently English spirit, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span> same honesty and clearness
of idea, the same stolidity of purpose, and not infrequently of
execution also; the same enthusiasm characterizes all his earlier, and
much of his later work; the enthusiasm especially characteristic of
Elizabethan England, and shown by Drayton in his passion for England and
the English, in his triumphant joy in their splendid past, and his
certainty of their future glory. As a poet, he lacked imagination and
fine fury; he supplied their place by the airiest and clearest of
fancies, by the strenuous labour of a great brain illumined by the
steady flame of love for his country and for his lady. Mr. Courthope has
said that he lacked loftiness and resolution of artistic purpose;
without these, we ask, how could a man, not lavishly dowered with poetry
in his soul, have achieved so much of it? It was his very fixity and
loftiness of purpose, his English stubbornness and doggedness of
resolution that enabled him to surmount so many obstacles of style and
metre, of subject and thought. His two purposes, of glorifying his
mistress and his friends, and of sounding England's glories past and
future, while insisting on the dangers of a present decadence, never
flagged or failed. All his poetry up to 1627 has this object directly or
secondarily; and much after this date. Of the more abstract and
universal aspects of his art he had not much conception; but he caught
eagerly at the fashionable belief in the eternizing power of poetry; and
had it not been that, where his patriotism was uppermost, he was
deficient in humour and sense of proportion, he would have succeeded
better: as it is, his more directly patriotic pieces are usually the
dullest or longest of his works. He requires, like all other poets, the
impulse of an absolutely personal and individual feeling, a moment of
more intimate sympathy, to rouse him to his heights of song. Thus the
<i>Ballad of Agincourt</i> is on the very theme of all patriotic themes that
most attracted him; Virginian and other Voyages lay very close to his
heart; and in certain sonnets to his lady lies his only imperishable
work. Of sheer melody and power of song he had little, apart from his
themes: he could not have sat down and written a few lark's or
nightingale's notes about nothing as some of his contemporaries were
able to do: he required the stimulus of a subject, and if he were really
moved thereby<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span> he beat the music out. Only in one or two of the later
Odes, and in the volumes of 1627 and 1630, does his music ever seem to
flow from him naturally. Akin to this quality of broad and extensive
workmanship, to this faculty of taking a subject and when writing, with
all thought concentrated on it, rather than on the method of writing
about it, is his strange lack of what are usually called 'quotations'.
For this is not only due to the fact that he is little known; there are,
besides, so few detached remarks or aphorisms that are separately
quotable; so few examples of that <i>curiosa felicitas</i> of diction: lines
like these,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thy Bowe, halfe broke, is peec'd with old desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her Bowe is beauty with ten thousand strings....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>are rare enough. Drayton, in fact, comes as near controverting the
statement <i>Poeta nascitur, non fit</i>, as any one in English literature:
by diligent toil and earnest desire he won a place for himself in the
second rank of English poets: through love he once set foot in the
circle of the mightiest. Sincere he was always, simple often, sensuous
rarely. His great industry, his careful study, and his great receptivity
are shown in the unusual spectacle of a man who has sung well in the
language of his youth, suddenly learning, in his age, the tongue spoken
by the younger generation, and reproducing it with individuality and
sureness of touch. It is in rhetoric, splendid or rugged, in argument,
in plain statement or description, in the outline sketch of a picture,
that Drayton excels; magic of atmosphere and colouring are rarely
present. Stolidity is, perhaps, his besetting sin; yet it is the sign of
a slow, not a dull, intellect; an intellect, like his heart, which never
let slip what it had once taken to itself.</p>

<p>As a man Drayton would seem to have been an excellent type of the
sturdy, clear-headed, but yet romantic and enthusiastic Englishman;
gifted with much natural ability, sedulously increased by study; quietly
humorous, self-restrained; and if temporarily soured by disappointment
and the disjointed times, yet emerging at last into a greater serenity,
a more unadulterated gaiety than had ever before characterized him. It
is possible, but from his clear and sane balance of mind improbable,
that many of his light later poems are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span> due to deliberate self-blinding
and self-deception, a walking in enchanted lands of the mind.</p>

<p>Of Drayton's three known portraits the earliest shows him at the age of
thirty-six, and is now in the National Portrait Gallery. A look of
quiet, speculative melancholy seems to pervade it; there is, as yet, no
moroseness, no evidence of severe conflict with the world, no shadow of
stress or of doubt. The second and best-known portrait shows us Drayton
at the age of fifty, and was engraved by Hole, as a frontispiece to the
poems of 1619. Here a notable change has come over the face; the mouth
is hardened, and depressed at the corners through disappointment and
disillusionment; the eyes are full of a pathos increased by the puzzled
and perturbed uplift of the brows. Yet a stubbornness and tenacity of
purpose invests the features and reminds us that Drayton is of the old
and sound Elizabethan stock, 'on evil days though fallen.' Let it be
remembered, that he was in 1613, when the portrait was taken, in more or
less prosperous circumstances; it was the sad degeneracy, the meanness
and feebleness of the generation around him, that chiefly depressed and
embittered him. The final portrait, now in the Dulwich Gallery,
represents the poet as a man of sixty-five; and is quite in keeping with
the sunnier and calmer tone of his later poetry. It is the face of one
who has not emerged unscathed from the world's conflict, but has
attained to a certain calm, a measure of tranquillity, a portion of
content, who has learnt the lesson that there is a soul of goodness in
things evil. The Hole portrait shows him with long hair, small 'goatee'
beard, and aquiline nose drawn up at the nostrils: while the National
portrait shows a type of nose and beard intermediate between the Hole
and the Dulwich pictures: the general contour of the face, though the
forehead is broad enough, is long and oval. Drayton seems to have been
tall and thin, and to have been very susceptible of cold, and therefore
to have hated Winter and the North.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> He is said to have shared in the
supper which caused Shakespeare's death; but his own verses<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> breathe
the spirit of Milton's sonnet to Cyriack Skinner, rather than that of a
devotee of Bacchus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>He died in 1631, possibly on December 23, and was buried under the North
wall of Westminster Abbey. Meres's<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> opinion of his character during
his early life is as follows: 'As Aulus Persius Flaccus is reported
among al writers to be of an honest life and vpright conuersation: so
Michael Drayton, <i>quem totics honoris et amoris causa nomino</i>, among
schollers, souldiours, Poets, and all sorts of people is helde for a man
of uertuous disposition, honest conversation, and well gouerned cariage;
which is almost miraculous among good wits in these declining and
corrupt times, when there is nothing but rogery in villanous man, and
when cheating and craftines is counted the cleanest wit, and soundest
wisedome.'<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Fuller also, in a similar strain, says, 'He was a pious
poet, his conscience having the command of his fancy, very temperate in
his life, slow of speech, and inoffensive in company.'</p>

<p>In conclusion I have to thank Mr. H.M. Sanders, of Pembroke College,
Oxford, for help and advice, and Professor Raleigh and Mr. R.W. Chapman
for help and criticism while the volume was in the press. Above all, I
am at every turn indebted to Professor Elton's invaluable <i>Michael
Drayton</i>,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> without which the work of any student of Drayton would be
rendered, if not impossible, at least infinitely harder.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">My dearely loued friend how oft haue we,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In winter evenings (meaning to be free,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To some well-chosen place vs'd to retire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there with moderate meate, and wine, and fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haue past the howres contentedly with chat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now talk of this, and then discours'd of that,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke our owne verses 'twixt our selves, if not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Other mens lines, which we by chance had got,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or some Stage pieces famous long before,<br /></span>
<span class='linenum'>10</span><span class="i0">Of which your happy memory had store;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I remember you much pleased were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those who liued long agoe to heare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well as of those, of these latter times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who have inricht our language with their rimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in succession, how still vp they grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which is the subiect, that I now pursue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For from my cradle, (you must know that) I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was still inclin'd to noble Poesie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when that once <i>Pueriles</i> I had read,<br /></span>
<span class='linenum'>20</span><span class="i0">And newly had my <i>Cato</i> construed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In my small selfe I greatly marueil'd then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amonst all other, what strange kinde of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These Poets were; And pleased with the name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To my milde Tutor merrily I came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For I was then a proper goodly page,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much like a Pigmy, scarse ten yeares of age)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clasping my slender armes about his thigh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O my deare master! cannot you (quoth I)<br /></span>

<span class='linenum'>30</span><span class="i0">And you shall see, Ile quickly bee a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who me thus answered smiling, boy quoth he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you'le not play the wag, but I may see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You ply your learning, I will shortly read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some Poets to you; <i>Ph&#339;bus</i> be my speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too't hard went I, when shortly he began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And first read to me honest <i>Mantuan</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then <i>Virgils Eglogues</i>, being entred thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me thought I straight had mounted <i>Pegasus</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his full Careere could make him stop,<br /></span>
<span class='linenum'>40</span><span class="i0">And bound vpon <i>Parnassus'</i> by-clift top.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I scornd your ballet then though it were done<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But soft, in sporting with this childish iest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I from my subiect haue too long digrest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to the matter that we tooke in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ioue</i> and <i>Apollo</i> for the <i>Muses</i> stand.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then noble <i>Chaucer</i>, in those former times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first inrich'd our <i>English</i> with his rimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was the first of ours, that euer brake,<br /></span>
<span class='linenum'>50</span><span class="i0">Into the <i>Muses</i> treasure, and first spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In weighty numbers, deluing in the Mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of perfect knowledge, which he could refine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And coyne for currant, and as much as then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <i>English</i> language could expresse to men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He made it doe; and by his wondrous skill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gaue vs much light from his abundant quill.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And honest <i>Gower</i>, who in respect of him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had only sipt at <i>Aganippas</i> brimme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though in yeares this last was him before,<br /></span>
<span class='linenum'>60</span><span class="i0">Yet fell he far short of the others store.<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Wyat</i>; with reuerence whom we still doe name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amongst our Poets, <i>Brian</i> had a share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the two former, which accompted are<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span><span class="i0">That times best makers, and the authors were<br /></span>
<span class='linenum'>70</span><span class="i0">Of those small poems, which the title beare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of songs and sonnets, wherein oft they hit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On many dainty passages of wit.<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Gascoine</i> and <i>Churchyard</i> after them againe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the beginning of <i>Eliza's</i> raine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accoumpted were great Meterers many a day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not inspired with braue fier, had they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Liu'd but a little longer, they had seene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their works before them to have buried beene.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Graue morrall <i>Spencer</i> after these came on<br /></span>
<span class='linenum'>80</span><span class="i0">Then whom I am perswaded there was none<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since the blind <i>Bard</i> his <i>Iliads</i> vp did make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fitter a taske like that to vndertake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To set downe boldly, brauely to inuent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all high knowledge, surely excellent.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The noble <i>Sidney</i> with this last arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That <i>Heroe</i> for numbers, and for Prose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That throughly pac'd our language as to show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The plenteous <i>English</i> hand in hand might goe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With <i>Greek</i> or <i>Latine</i>, and did first reduce<br /></span>
<span class='linenum'>90</span><span class="i0">Our tongue from <i>Lillies</i> writing then in vse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talking of Stones, Stars, Plants, of fishes, Flyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Playing with words, and idle Similies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As th' <i>English</i>, Apes and very Zanies be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of euery thing, that they doe heare and see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So imitating his ridiculous tricks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They spake and writ, all like meere lunatiques.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then <i>Warner</i> though his lines were not so trim'd,<br /></span>

<span class='linenum'>100</span><span class="i0">Easily reprooue him, yet thus let me say;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my old friend, some passages there be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In him, which I protest haue taken me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With almost wonder, so fine, cleere, and new<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As yet they haue bin equalled by few.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Neat <i>Marlow</i> bathed in the <i>Thespian</i> springs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had in him those braue translunary things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the first Poets had, his raptures were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All ayre, and fire, which made his verses cleere,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span><span class="i0">For that fine madnes still he did retaine,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A branch of Lawrell yet deserues to beare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharply <i>Satirick</i> was he, and that way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He went, since that his being, to this day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Few haue attempted, and I surely thinke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those wordes shall hardly be set downe with inke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall scorch and blast, so as his could, where he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would inflict vengeance, and be it said of thee,<br /></span>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>


<p>In this Appendix, I have collected certain fugitive pieces of Drayton's;
chiefly commendatory verses prefixed to various friends' books. The
first song is from <i>England's Helicon</i>, and is, I think, too pretty to
be lost. Three of the commendatory poems are in sonnet-form, and their
inclusion brings us nearer the whole number published by Drayton; of
which there are doubtless a few still lacking. But I have tried to make
the collection of sonnets as complete as possible.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>


<p>These notes are not intended to supply materials for the criticism of
the text. So freely, indeed, did Drayton alter his poems for a fresh
edition, that the ordinary machinery of an <i>apparatus criticus</i> would be
overtasked if the attempt were made. All that has been undertaken here
is to provide the requisite information in places where the text
followed seemed open to suspicion.</p>

<p>It may be added that the punctuation of the originals has in general
been preserved; in a few flagrant instances, where the text as it stood
was misleading, it has been modified. Such changes are not noted here.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
